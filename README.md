### Proposal 

**What problem does your app solve?**
Potential users constantly can not think of new places to go out and eat at.
They always eat at the same places.
Users can’t see visual progress of the places they have been to, either for themselves or to show their friends. 

**Be as specific as possible; how does your app solve the problem?**
Our product solves this problem by suggesting restaurants nearby for users. This takes off the unnecessary stress of trying to figure out where to eat. It also solves their issue of always eating at the same place, because we are giving them new suggestions that they may not have been too. Lastly, they are able to track their visual progress for themselves or to show their friends, by using our passport ability. The passport ability gives them the ease of visually seeing where they have been by “punching off” a restaurant once they go to it. 

**What is the mission statement?**
At RestaurantPassport we aim to give our users a stress-free eating experience by easily finding somewhere to satisfy their stomachs.
Features (done)

**What features are required for your minimum viable product?**
The onboarding process for a new user. 
- Include their name, email, password, confirm password, and the name of the city for their first passport. 
Landing Page once logged in.
- Displays lists of restaurants from the city that the passport is assigned to. Have stamps/punches on the restaurant cards that the user has marked off, to easily remind them that they have been there. This page is one long scroll page. 
Single Restaurant View Page. 
- This is the page users will see once they click on a restaurant on the main landing page. This needs to give the user the ability to view details, mark that they have visited the restaurant (which will update the homepage with a stamp or punch), or delete the restaurant from appearing in their passport. 
Navigation must be present on all pages, users should know what page is active by clicking on a nav link and activating their tab. 

**What features may you wish to put in a future release?**
In a future release, I would like to put in the ability to add more than one city to your passport, be able to order delivery or place reservations through the app, and add the ability to invite friends to create a social platform out of it. 

**What do the top 3 similar apps do for their users?**
Yelp is very similar. They give suggestions to their users and all the details they would want to know about a restaurant. However, they do not give the ability to “punch off” somewhere they have been to. Google Maps and Apple Maps both give users the ability to search for food places near them. However, not only do they not give them the ability to punch things off, but they also give many food-chain and fast-food suggestions that are useless to most users. 
Frameworks - Libraries (done)

- What 3rd party frameworks/libraries are you considering using?
Axios | Redux |

- Do APIs require you to contact its maintainer to gain access?
No

- Are you required to pay to use the API?
No

- Have you considered using Apple Frameworks? (MapKit, Healthkit, ARKit?)
No
For Data Scientists


- Describe the Established data source with at least rough data able to be provided on day 1. 
- You can gather information about the data set you’ll be working with from the project description. Be sure to collaborate with your PM, and your Backend Architect to chat about the resources you have.
- Write a description for what the DS problem is (what uncertainty/prediction are we trying to do here? Sentiment analysis? Why is this a useful solution to a problem?)
- A target (e.g. JSON format or such) for output that DS students can deliver to web/other students for them to ingest and use in the app

### Target Audience

Who is your target audience? Be specific.
Our target audience ideally is millennials, which are in the age range of 23-38 years of age. Research shows that they are the demographic that eats out the most. Forty-nine percent of them spend more on eating out than saving money for their futures. 
We also ideally want to reach singles, although we don’t want to only focus on them. Singles are more likely to eat out, instead of people in relationships, because of the cost. It’s cheaper for a couple to stay home and eat there instead of going out. 
Extroverts are more likely to eat out because introverts can get stressed out in public settings where they have to make conversation. They often get asked “what's wrong” when they go out, because they are so quiet, which makes them want to stay within their comfort zone at home. 
Lastly, middle class or higher are our targets because they have the financial ability to go out and eat more often. 


**What feedback have you gotten from potential users?**
I conducted a personal interview for a potential user who fit our target demographic from the screener survey. From talking to him, I determined the main themes in his current lifestyle that correlate to our product. He spoke about how money/finances determine his habits. Although he has money to go out often if he had more money he would go out even more. He is mobile phone dominate and doesn’t use a laptop or desktop often, so a mobile web app would be more applicable to him. Since he uses his phone, his current applications on it do not give him as much control as he would like. He likes variety in his life and wants more of it, especially in food. And lastly, he works often, so ease is important to him. He needs the applications he uses to be easy for him to use and create less stress on his life. Using all of this information I was able to apply the things he said to better build our product’s designs. 


Have you validated the problem and your solution with your target audience? How?
Yes, we currently do not have any problems that users have come across since we are building our MVP right now. However, from speaking to our target audience, I have heard that the main concern is how well the product suggests places to eat. They showed a lot of distaste for suggestions on yelp, and iPhone maps, because many are popular chain restaurants. The solution is to make sure when we create the platform, that we also give them the ability to filter from non-chain restaurants. Giving them more ability within the app to narrow down their searches, will be a huge factor in the success of the product. 

### Research

- Research thoroughly before writing a single line of code. Solidify the features of your app conceptually before implementation. Spend the weekend researching so you can hit the ground running on Monday.
Prototype Key Feature(s)

- This is the “bread and butter” of the app, this is what makes your app yours. Calculate how long it takes to implement these features and triple the time estimated. That way you’ll have plenty of time to finish. It is preferred to drop features and spend more time working on your MVP features if needed.
